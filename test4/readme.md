### some points discovered esprecially while experimenting this

# keep testing and exprimenting AND FINAL DATSET SAME.

**currently only focus on group of 4 tiles** neither 1 nor the unwanted extra stuff

- segrigate based on area
  cause you always wont get the perfect tile contour in every frame

and send the pdf to sir so he could possibly forward
